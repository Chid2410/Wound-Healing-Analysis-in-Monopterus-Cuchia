# Wound Healing Analysis in Monopterus Cuchia(Swamp Eel) Using ML/DL
This repo contains the code of my final year project on "Wound Healing Analysis in Monopterus Cuchia" as fulfillment of MTech in IT from the Department of Information Technology, Gauhati University.
The goal is to identify and understand the wound healing duration and patterns in fish with and without medicinal treatment, using ML/DL techniques. The project is carried out in collaboration with Department of Zoology,Gauhati University.



## Dataset
The Dataset is collected from Department of Zoology,and not publicly available.

## Notebooks

We trained three different machine learning models to classify vehicle and non-vehicle. For more details about the models and their performance, refer to the project report in the `documentation` directory.

- `Mysequential_CNN.ipynb`: G-colab Notebook for vehicle detection using sequentail personal customized CNN model.
- `vehicleDetection_EffNetB0.ipynb`: G-colab Notebook for vehicle detection using customized efficientNetB0 model.
- `vehicleDetection_VGG16.ipynb`: G-colab Notebook for vehicle detection using  customized VGG16 model.
-K-Means Clustering – for identifying healing-stage clusters.
-CuchiaNet Model (MobileNet-based) – your custom deep learning CNN for wound image classification or healing prediction.
-Streamlit App – for interactive visualization of CuchiaNet’s outputs and wound healing progress.
